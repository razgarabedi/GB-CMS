# Roadmap for Achieving Modularity in the Signage Program

## Introduction
This roadmap outlines the steps necessary to transform the Signage program into a modular system, allowing users to create and customize their own layouts with ease.

## Current Widget Structure
The widgets in the codebase, such as `PVFlowWidget`, `WeatherWidget`, `PVCompactWidget`, and `NewsWidget`, are implemented as React components. They utilize props for configuration, state management for dynamic data, and effects for data fetching and updates.

## Modular Design Alignment

### Slider, Welcome Text, and Website Viewer

1. **Component-Based Architecture**:
   - **Enhancement**: Ensure each of these components (slider, welcome text, website viewer) is self-contained with clear interfaces for inputs (props) and outputs (events or callbacks). This will allow them to be easily reused and composed into different layouts.

2. **Configuration Files**:
   - **Enhancement**: Introduce configuration files (e.g., JSON) that define the properties and behavior of each component. This allows users to customize these components without modifying the code.

3. **Template System**:
   - **Enhancement**: Develop a set of predefined templates for common layouts that include these components. Users can select a template as a starting point and customize it further.

4. **Plugin Support**:
   - **Enhancement**: Define a plugin architecture that allows third-party developers to create new components or extend existing ones. This can be achieved by exposing a clear API and lifecycle methods for plugins.

5. **User Interface**:
   - **Enhancement**: Design a user-friendly interface for customizing these components, including a visual editor with drag-and-drop capabilities, property panels for component settings, and a preview mode.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Define Component Interfaces**:
   - Establish interfaces for the slider, welcome text, and website viewer to ensure consistency and interoperability. Each component should adhere to these interfaces for seamless integration.

2. **Create Configuration Management**:
   - Implement a system for loading, saving, and applying configuration files. Ensure that changes to component settings are persisted and can be easily reverted.

3. **Build the Template System**:
   - Develop a library of templates that users can choose from. Provide options for exporting and importing templates to facilitate sharing and collaboration.

4. **Establish Plugin Architecture**:
   - Define a plugin architecture that allows for easy integration of new components. Document the API and provide examples to guide third-party developers.

5. **Design the User Interface**:
   - Focus on creating a user-friendly interface for component customization. Conduct user testing to refine the design and ensure it meets user needs.

## Conclusion
By following this roadmap, the Signage program can become more modular, allowing users to create and customize their own layouts effectively. This will enhance user satisfaction and foster a community of developers contributing to the platform's growth and innovation.
