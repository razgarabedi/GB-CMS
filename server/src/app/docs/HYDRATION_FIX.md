# Hydration Error Fix

## Problem
The application was experiencing hydration errors due to server/client mismatch in time-based components. This occurred because:

1. **ClockWidget** and **WeatherWidget** were using `new Date()` in their initial state
2. Server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering produced different timestamps
3. This caused React hydration to fail with "server rendered text didn't match the client"

## Solution

### 1. Custom Hydration Hook
Created `useHydration.ts` with specialized hooks:

- `useHydration()`: Detects when component has hydrated on the client
- `useTimeData()`: Generic hook for time-sensitive data with hydration handling
- `useCurrentTime()`: Specific hook for current time with proper SSR handling

### 2. Updated Components
Modified both widgets to:

- Use `useCurrentTime()` hook instead of direct `new Date()`
- Show loading state during hydration (`--:--:--` for time, `-- --` for date)
- Only display actual time data after client-side hydration is complete

### 3. Key Changes

#### Before (Problematic):
```tsx
const [currentTime, setCurrentTime] = useState(new Date()); // ❌ Different on server/client
```

#### After (Fixed):
```tsx
const { value: currentTime, isHydrated } = useCurrentTime(1000); // ✅ Consistent hydration
```

### 4. Benefits

- **No more hydration errors**: Server and client render identical content initially
- **Smooth user experience**: Loading states prevent layout shifts
- **Reusable solution**: Hook can be used in other time-based components
- **Performance**: Only updates time after hydration is complete

### 5. Usage

For any new time-based components, use the hydration hooks:

```tsx
import { useCurrentTime, useHydration } from '../hooks/useHydration';

// For time data
const { value: currentTime, isHydrated } = useCurrentTime(1000);

// For general hydration detection
const isHydrated = useHydration();

// Show loading state during hydration
if (!isHydrated) {
  return <LoadingComponent />;
}
```

This ensures all time-based components work correctly with Next.js SSR without hydration mismatches.
