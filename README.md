 GB CMS is a cloud-based content management system for digital signage. It's designed to help businesses of all sizes create, schedule, and manage content on their digital displays from a single, secure platform. The "GB" stands for "Visual eXperience Transformation," and the platform combines a content management system (CMS) with remote signage management.


Here's a breakdown of what  GB CMS offers:

Key Features and Benefits:

Content Creation: GB CMS includes a tool called GB Canvas, which is an easy-to-use content creation application. It offers a wide variety of professionally designed templates, custom fonts, and a drag-and-drop interface, allowing even non-designers to create engaging content like digital menus, promotions, and announcements.


Content Management and Scheduling: The system makes it simple to upload and organize content, create playlists, and schedule when and where that content will be displayed. You can manage a single screen or a network of hundreds of displays from anywhere in the world.


Remote Management: A key advantage of GB is its robust remote management capabilities. You can monitor the status of your screens in real-time, adjust settings like brightness, and even power them on and off remotely, which reduces the need for on-site visits.

Security and Stability: GB offers advanced security features, including the ability to lock down USB ports, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi networks. It also has a proactive early warning system that can detect potential issues like a severe temperature increase or a weak network signal, sending you an alert before a problem affects a display.


Versatile Compatibility: While designed for digital signage hardware, GB is also compatible with a variety of other displays that run on an Android OS and can download the GB app.

Use Cases: GB is suitable for a wide range of industries, including retail, food and beverage (digital menu boards), corporate communications, and transportation hubs (live schedules and announcements).
